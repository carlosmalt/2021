**Submission**
Submit (single-blind) via EasyChair (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=precs21). We look for two categories of submissions:

Position papers. This category is for papers whose goal is to propose solutions (or scope the work that needs to be done) to address some of the issues outlined above. We hope that a research agenda comes out of this and that we can create a community that meets yearly to report on our status in addressing these problems.

Experience papers. This category consists of papers reporting on the authorsâ€™ experience in automating one or more experimentation pipelines. The committee will look for submissions reporting on their experience: what worked? What aspects of experiment automation and validation are hard in your domain? What can be done to improve the tooling for your domain? As part of the submission, authors need to provide a URL to the automation service they use (e.g., TravisCI, GitLabCI, CircleCI, Jenkins, etc.) so reviewers can verify that there is one or more automated pipelines associated to the submission.

Format
Authors are invited to submit manuscripts in English not exceeding 5 pages of content. The 5-page limit includes figures, tables and appendices, but does not include references, for which there is no page limit. Submissions must use the ACM Master Template (please use the sigconf format with default options).

**Tools**
These tools can be used used to automate your experiments (not an exhaustive list):  [CK](http://ctuning.org), [CWL](http://commonwl.org), 
[Popper](https://github.com/systemslab/popper), 
[ReproZip](http://reprozip.org), [Sciunit](http://sciunit.run), 
[Sumatra](https://github.com/open-research/sumatra).

**Proceedings**: Proceedings will be uploaded to the [ACM Digital 
Library][dl]. Every talk in the program links to its corresponding 
entry in the digital library as well.

**Registration**: We will use the HPDC registration system and the
virtual conference platform.
Registration: One author of each accepted paper has to register for HPDC'21 with author registration. Registration is common for the conference and workshops. Please find registration information on the HPDC'21 website at http://www.hpdc.org/2021/ Please register using this link https://cvent.me/L4BkD2 

In addition, we will use the #precs21 
channel of the [P-RECS Slack workspace][joinslack].

------------

The P-RECS workshop focuses heavily on practical, actionable aspects 
of reproducibility in broad areas of computational science and data 
exploration, with special emphasis on issues in which community 
collaboration can be essential for adopting novel methodologies, 
techniques and frameworks aimed at addressing some of the challenges 
we face today. The workshop brings together researchers and experts to 
share experiences and advance the state of the art in the reproducible 
evaluation of computer systems, featuring contributed papers and 
invited talks.
