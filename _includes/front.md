------------

The P-RECS workshop focuses heavily on practical, actionable aspects 
of reproducibility in broad areas of computational science and data 
exploration, with special emphasis on issues in which community 
collaboration can be essential for adopting novel methodologies, 
techniques and frameworks aimed at addressing some of the challenges 
we face today. The workshop brings together researchers and experts to 
share experiences and advance the state of the art in the reproducible 
evaluation of computer systems, featuring contributed papers and 
invited talks.
