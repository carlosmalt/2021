------------

The P-RECS workshop focuses heavily on practical, actionable aspects 
of reproducibility in broad areas of computational science and data 
exploration, with special emphasis on issues in which community 
collaboration can be essential for adopting novel methodologies, 
techniques and frameworks aimed at addressing some of the challenges 
we face today. The workshop brings together researchers and experts to 
share experiences and advance the state of the art in the reproducible 
evaluation of computer systems, featuring contributed papers and 
invited talks.

## Topics

We expect submissions from topics such as, but not limited to:

  * Experiment dependency management.
  * Software citation and persistence.
  * Data versioning and preservation.
  * Provenance of data-intensive experiments.
  * Tools and techniques for incorporating provenance into publications.
  * Automated experiment execution and validation.
  * Experiment portability for code, performance, and related metrics.
  * Experiment discoverability for re-use.
  * Cost-benefit analysis frameworks for reproducibility.
  * Usability and adaptability of reproducibility frameworks into already-established domain-specific tools.
  * Long-term artifact archiving for future reproducibility.
  * Frameworks for sociological constructs to incentivize paradigm shifts.
  * Policies around publication of articles/software.
  * Blinding and selecting artifacts for review while maintaining history.
  * Reproducibility-aware computational infrastructure.
